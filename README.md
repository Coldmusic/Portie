# Portie
Portie is an FM Receiver app. The project also contains a simplier version of an FM Receiver.

The app requires GNU Radio, RTL-SDR, and USB Receiver and antenna. Originally, the project is desined to create a portable
FM Receiver using Raspberry Pi, USB Receiver, and GNU Radio. However, the app works in MAC OS and Linux. Linux and Raspberry Pi
versions are the same.

To use, plug in USB Receiver and run:

python portie_fm.py
